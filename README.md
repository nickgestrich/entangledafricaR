entangledafricaR is where the network analysis working group of the DFG
Priority Programme “Entangled Africa” shares R code. The aim is for
members to be able to easily create and evaluate network models using
the instructions provided here, and for new network approaches to be
developed and shared. Specific implementations should be shared along
with publications. By contrast, all code found here should be considered
as work in progress.

## Installation

You can install the development version of entagledafricaR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nickgestrich/entangledafricaR")
```

## Contents

Please see the `vignettes` folder for instructions on making networks
from archaeological data.

## Contributing

Members of the working group are encouraged to add their own workflows
to the `vignettes` folder as markdown documents, and their functions to
the `R` folder. You may also submit them to Nick Gestrich
(<gestrich@uni-frankfurt.de>) for uploading in the correct format.
